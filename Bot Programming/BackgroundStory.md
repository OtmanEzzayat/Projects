# BackGround Story

Crematoria is a planet in the Igneon System. Many years ago, its surface was
not habitable because of its extreme temperatures: one would be incinerated if
in the sunlight, or frozen solid at night. Because there was only a small buffer of
minutes where travel on the surface was possible, a maximum security prison
was built in some caves underground, from where it was almost impossible to
escape. Some elevators connected the surface of the planet to the prison.
To increase security and control the population, some huge hellhounds were
released in the prison. Those hellhounds were genetically engineered animals,
hybrids of dogs and reptiles, who indiscriminately attacked and devoured any
inmates that could not avoid them.
It is known that at least one Furyan (Riddick) was temporarily locked inside the
prison of Crematoria. Furyans are a deviation of humans with great physical
abilities, which make them the most fearsome warriors.

Necromongers are the natural enemies of Furyans. Necromongers fanatically
believe in the Underverse, their promised land. Therefore, they search for
an honorable death in combat. The Necromonger fleet moves from planet to
planet, appearing as a comet before arrival.

Necromongers also believe in a philosophy that says “you keep what you kill”,
meaning that ending another’s life entitles you to their property.

Many years passed, and the surface of Crematoria became walkable at night.
This fact made the prison less secure, so it was abandoned. Recently, it has
been discovered that the sunlight generates valuable gems. Four rival groups
of pioneers have decided to establish themselves in Crematoria. The goal of
each group is twofold: to conquer underground cells, and to pick gems outside.

Since pioneers are weak, they decided to contract Furyan warriors to “protect”
them. This was not a great idea, because now pioneers are the prey of the
Furyans of the rival groups. Additionally, Necromongers are attracted by the
presence of Furyans at Crematoria, and they land every now and then on its
surface. To make things worse, three hellhounds are still in the caves, and they
are hungry...
